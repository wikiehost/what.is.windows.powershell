Before we dive into PowerShell, let's first nail down another question: "Whatâ€™s a shell?"

* A shell is a computer program that takes commands through the keyboard, interprets them, and relays them onto the operating system to execute. Essentially, it acts as an interface between you and the operating system. It can either be GUI (graphical user interface) based, or it can be built on top of a CLI (command-line interface).

* Although shell has been around since the Multics operating system launched in 1969, Windows introduced its version, the Shell, in November 1985. It was a basic shell that was useful for managing files, called MS-DOS Executive. Developments of this basic shell followed, but there was always a need for something more powerful.

* Earlier in Windows history, users resorted to using different tools for system administration and automation. In 2006, a major improvement of the Shell concept was introduced as a solution: Windows PowerShell.

* The Windows PowerShell lets you perform various operations, ranging from automating repetitive tasks, network administration, and so on, to tasks that demand more attention and creativity (like website content publishing, designing, etc.).

Not only does this save you time, but it also gives you greater control over the operating system and its processes.
